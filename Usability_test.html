	<h1>Usability Test</h1>
	<hr />

	<p>The user (male in mid twenties) was first debriefed on what the website is about and what their aim is (to view the results and standings). When the user first looked at the website, they seemed a bit lost and confused. The first thing they noticed was the black background  on the home page. After having a quick look at the home page, the user found the tab for draw/results without any issues.
	<br />
	They commented about the small fonts of the text in the navigation bar and how it took them a little longer to read. After navigating to the draw/results page they easily noticed the information present in the table and had no trouble processing it. The user then mentioned that the colour of the text present in the table was merging with the navigation bar and that they found it a bit distracting.
	<br />
	Then the user proceeded to the standings page. They saw the standings table in the body of the page and found it very easy to look at. The comments for the font colour was the same as the one mentioned on the draw/results page. The user navigated back to the home page in the end. The user mentioned that they found the colour of the navigation bar to bright and distracting. Overall, the user was very happy with the simpleness of the site and was never confused about which path to take to complete the site.
	<br />
	Suggestions made by user:
	<br />
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Change the dark background on the home page.</li>
		<li>Increase the size of the text in the navigation bar</li>
		<li>Change the colour of the fonts in the results and standings table</li>
		<li>Make the colour of the navigation bar a less bright.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>All of the things mentioned above were improved on. The user was asked to review the site again and they were pleased with the improvements.</p>

	<p>Shown below is an example of an improvement made. Obviously not all improvements could fit onto the page, so only one of them is shown. The images are set as links so that they can be viewed at full resolution.</p>

	<p>(The 2 arrow images missing on the first page are not a problem. They were present when the user used the site. I was just making a few ammendments when I took the screenshot.)

	Images are cropped and not representative of the functional prototype.
