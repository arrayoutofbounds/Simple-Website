	<h4 id="hta">Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)</h4>
	<p>The HTA for the website is in a pdf version(includes the footnotes). <a href="hta.pdf">hta.pdf</a></p>

	<h4 id="colour_scheme">Colour Scheme</h4>
	<p>The colour scheme of the website is monochromatic. Blue is used at different tones and shades on all elements (Except background).<p>

 	<p>The navigation bar, headings and logo text are all shades of blue. Black, grey and white are used for arrows and text. The light background on the home page creates a contrast and allows the stronger subjects to be emphasized. In this case, it is the logo and images on the slider. On the draw and standings the light background also creates the contrast that emphasizes the tables clearly.</p>

 	<p id="sub1">Colour information:</p>
	<p>Navigation bar :  R:0, G:104, B:139 (#00688B) <br /> Logo text: R:2, G:151, B:236  (#0297ec) <br /> Background: Shattered and Notebook patterns.</p>

	<p id="sub2">Url from paletton.com for the colours:</p>
	<p>Navigation bar: <a href="http://paletton.com/#uid=13p0u0k++rVUZZA+VCl+Xmj+Bgh">http://paletton.com/#uid=13p0u0k++rVUZZA+VCl+Xmj+Bgh</a> <br /> Text beside logo: <a href="http://paletton.com/export/index.php">http://paletton.com/export/index.php</a> </p>

	<h4 id="lines">Lines, Borders and Background schemes</h4>
	<p>The body of the website ( in the middle ) is seperated from the top of the website by a line.  This line also allows the body of the website to be styled differently on each page while the top remains consistent in its style. 
	<br />
	The website has lines and borders that are sharp to show that clear distiction between the elements. The Latest updates and Contact boxes are seperated by a thick border to make the grouping clear and show that there is no relationship between those boxes.
	<br />
	The background used is very light in colour to allow the darker components on top to stand out. The lighter colour also allows the text to be easily readable.

	<h4 id="font_scheme">Font Scheme</h4>
	<p>
		Sans-Serif fonts are used for the navigation bar, information in tables and information on sliding images as it is easy for the user to read. The font size is also bigger to allow people who do not have 20/20 vision to read properly. The straight ends to letters that they have also makes the design cleaner.
	</p>
	<p>
		Serif font types (e.g Hoefler text) are used for the Latest updates and Contact Us boxes because fonts in those family are considered to be easy for the user to read. Any headings of columns, tables or paragraphs are larger in size to emphasize the content that they cover.
	</p>

	<h4 id="anl">Assumptions and Limitations</h4>

	<p>My main focus was to make the website very easy to use. For that I had to sacrifice on extra functionalities and make some tough choices.</p>

	<p>I assumed that the user was already logged in. I also did not put a logout button as it would be pointless in this sense as there is no page to go if that button was pressed.</p>

	<p>I assumed that the user was a player and wanted to just view the results and standings. For the standings and results, I assumed that the player was looking at the website after the playing season had started (this helped me show some values in the tables).</p>

	<p>For the Latest Updates tables I assumed that it shows information about the events that occurred in the past week. Each of those latest updates will be a link to the news page (which will be implemented in the real webiste).</p>

	<p>I also had some limitations in the design. I had originally planned to allow the user traverse the standings and results tables using the next and numbered buttons. However, I had to focus more on the design and could not make a function that would allow the table to change as the next button is clicked.</p>
